# Smoove JS

> A small helper library for FLIP animations

## What the FLIP?

The FLIP approach to animation, coined by Paul Lewis, translates transitions of expensive style-properties (`width`, `height`, `top`, `left`, etc.) to more performant transitions using transforms. For an explanation as to why these pixel-based transitions often result in UI jank, I highly recommend [this article](https://aerotwist.com/blog/pixels-are-expensive/) that goes into some detail about this.

## Install

```shell
$ npm i smoove-js
```

## Getting started

To get started, I recommend having a look at an example implementation, such as in `demo/main.js`. The first thing you will want to do when transitioning an element with Smoove is to initialize an animation, passing the DOM-element you wish to transition.

```js
import smoove from 'smoove-js'

const myEl = document.getElementById('el')
const myAnim = smoove.init(myEl)
```

Now, to transition the element, simply call the animate method on `myAnim` and pass a callback that applies the element's style change(s).

```js
myAnim.animate(() => (myEl.style.left = '100px'))
```

| ---- | ----------- | :------: | ------------------ |
| el   | HTMLElement |    ✅    | Target DOM element |

### `<AnimObj>.measure() => <AnimObj>`

Measures the current position of target element.

### `<AnimObj>.animate(stylingFn, animationOpts) => <AnimObj>`

Animates target element from bounds (based on previous measure or init) to bounds after callback.
